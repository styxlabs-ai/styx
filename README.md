# Styx

**Compliance infrastructure for tokenized real estate.**

Every property deal — human or AI agent — must cross through compliance before closing. Styx automates that crossing.

---

## What It Does

Styx is a stateless compliance API. Platforms and AI agents send deal data, Styx runs checks against federal regulations and 50-state rules, and returns a compliance result. No PII stored.

- Sanctions screening
- Jurisdiction compliance (all 50 states + DC)
- FinCEN RRE determination and filing
- Legal, brokerage, and lending compliance
- KYC / identity verification
- FIRPTA withholding
- ERC-3643 claim issuance
- Deal pipeline orchestration

## Payment

Two authentication modes:

- **[x402](https://x402.org)** — Pay-per-request in USDC on Base. No accounts, no API keys. AI agents pay and get a compliance result.
- **API keys** — For enterprise integrations with volume pricing.

## Who This Is For

- **Tokenization platforms** — plug compliance into your closing flow
- **Title companies** — automate FinCEN filing, jurisdiction checks, and disclosure validation
- **AI agents** — autonomously pay for and consume compliance checks
- **Proptech builders** — embed compliance into any real estate transaction workflow

## Status

Private pilot. API docs and integration guides are available to partners under NDA.
